# FujiNet HAL Architecture Rules

FujiNet is a multi-peripheral emulator and WiFi network device for vintage computers.
The first completed hardware was for the Atari 8-Bit line of computers and development
has begun for other systems (Coleco ADAM, Apple II, Commodore 64, Atari Lynx, ZX Spectrum
and more) with the goal of supporting as many old systems as possible.

What sets FujiNet apart from other WiFi devices is the new Network Device (the N Device).
The N device allows vintage computers that do not have enough processing power to handle
TCP/IP connections themselves to talk to the modern internet over WiFi. Virtual adapters
have been created for many protocols including: TCP, UDP, HTTP, FTP, TNFS, HTTPS (SSL/TLS),
SSH, TELNET, WebDAV and JSON parser.

Examples of Fujinet include:
- an esp32 adapter that plugs into an Atari 8 bit machine on the SIO port.
- an esp32 adapter that plugs into an Apple2 8 bit machine on the drive port using SmartPort protocol.
- an application running on X86 hardware that communicates over TCP 


In order to work as an application, or a library, this project follows Hardware Abstraction Layer principles.

## Layer Architecture

### 1. Device Layer (src/device/)
- Contains platform-agnostic device implementations
- Defines core traits and interfaces
- Handles protocol-specific logic
- Key components:
  - NetworkUrl: Parses device specifications
  - BaseHttpClient: Common HTTP functionality
  - NetworkDevice: Generic network device implementation

### 2. Platform Layer (src/platform/)
- Contains platform-specific implementations
- Implements device traits for specific platforms
- Handles platform-specific details
- Key components:
  - X86HttpClient: Platform-specific HTTP implementation
  - Platform-specific error handling
  - Platform-specific initialization

### 3. Host Layer (src/host/)
- Provides translation between host machine's communication protocol and platform layer
- Handles host-specific requirements (block sizes, timing, caching for the host to efficiently receive data over its communication protocol)
- Manages caching and buffering for host protocols
- Key components:
  - HostTranslator: Core host translation interface
  - Platform-specific host implementations
  - Host state management
  - Resource allocation and cleanup

### 4. FFI Layer (src/ffi/)
- Provides C/C++ interface bindings
- Handles C-Rust type conversions
- Maps internal errors to C error codes
- Key components:
  - FFI function declarations
  - Type conversion utilities
  - Error code mapping
  - Memory management utilities

## Error Handling

### Device Layer Errors
- DeviceError enum for platform-agnostic errors
- Protocol-specific error types
- Connection state errors

### Platform Layer Errors
- Platform-specific error handling
- Maps device errors to platform errors
- Network-specific error conditions

### Host Layer Errors
- Host-specific error handling
- Maps platform errors to host errors
- Resource management errors

### FFI Layer Errors
- Standard error codes (FN_ERR_*)
- Maps internal errors to standard codes
- Maintains error state for C interface

## Network Protocol Support

### HTTP/HTTPS
- Base implementation in device layer
- Platform-specific implementation in platform layer
- Host translation in host layer
- C interface in FFI layer

### Future Protocols
- Add new protocol support in device layer
- Implement platform support in platform layer
- Add host translation in host layer
- Add FFI bindings in FFI layer

## Code Organization

### Device Layer
- src/device/network/
  - protocols/: Protocol implementations
  - network_device.rs: Core device implementation
  - url.rs: URL parsing

### Platform Layer
- src/platform/x86/
  - network/: Platform-specific network code
  - http_client.rs: Platform HTTP implementation

### Host Layer
- src/host/
  - translator.rs: Host translation interface
  - platform/: Platform-specific host implementations
  - state.rs: Host state management

### FFI Layer
- src/ffi/
  - platform/: Platform-specific FFI
  - device.rs: Device FFI bindings
  - mod.rs: Common FFI utilities

## Development Guidelines

1. Keep platform-agnostic code in device layer
2. Platform-specific code belongs in platform layer
3. Host translation code belongs in host layer
4. C interface code belongs in FFI layer
5. Use existing error handling patterns
6. Follow established protocol implementation patterns
7. Maintain separation of concerns between layers
8. Use existing URL parsing and protocol handling
9. Add new protocols by extending existing patterns

## Testing

### Test Organization
- All tests must be located in `fujinet-hal/tests/` directory
- Tests are organized by layer and component:
  - `tests/device/`: Device layer tests

  - `protocols/`: Protocol-specific test implementations
- Test requirements:
  - Must use async/await for async operations
  - Must test error conditions and edge cases
  - Must verify protocol-specific behavior
  - Must use mock implementations where appropriate

### Platform Layer Tests (`tests/platform/`)

### Test Guidelines
1. Each test file should focus on a single component
2. Use descriptive test names that indicate the test purpose
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
4. Document test requirements and assumptions
5. Use appropriate test attributes (e.g., #[tokio::test])
6. Follow the same layer separation as the main code
7. Maintain test isolation and independence
8. Use appropriate test fixtures and setup/teardown
